# Machine Learning
Improving the classification algorithm performance can be done in many different ways, but the most popular approaches are to use bagging and boosting with different weak learners. In this paper, we use the Lung nodules data set generated from 2D lung nodule images and extracted into content-based features. The data consists of 810 instances with 65 useful feature attributes with four likelihood of malignancy ratings given by four different radiologists. We also use three different data preprocessing approaches (binning, balancing and feature extraction (PCA)) and fit six different classifiers in each preprocessed data. The comparison of each classifier on each data are also represented in the paper, in order to make assumption whether bagging or boosting is outperformed to one another.
